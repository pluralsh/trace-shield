Make rules more fine-grained
Use authorizer instead of hydrator for checking tenants
Expand what is now the hydrator to more smartly parse the method and URL so hydrate the tenants more accurately (for example: if it is a get request to mimir we will look for all tenants the user can read metrics from)
Add policy checking for login bindings on OAuth2 Client login
Start using https://github.com/ory/herodot for our webhook endpoints
Add policy fine-grained checking for our API
Allow for Bearer token and HTTP basic auth to work
If a request already contains a tenant header, rather than hydrating all tenants a user/client has access to check if the user/tenant has access to that tenant and don't modify the headers
